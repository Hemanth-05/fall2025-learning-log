## Topic: JavaScript - let, const, var and strings

### let, const, var
**let**
- Block-scoped.
- Only accessible inside the block {} where it was defined.
- Can be re-assigned, but cannot be re-declared in the same scope.

**const**
- Block-scoped (same as let).
- Also limited to the block where it’s defined.
- Cannot be re-assigned (constant). However, if it holds an object or array, the contents can be modified (properties/elements).

**var**
- Function-scoped (or globally scoped if not inside a function).
- This means if you declare var inside a block ({}), it’s still accessible outside that block (not limited to block scope).
- Can be re-assigned and re-declared in the same scope.

It’s best to avoid using var in modern JavaScript. let and const are safer and more predictable, while var exists mainly for legacy support. The only reason to learn var is to understand older codebases, but when writing new code, prefer let and const.

**Problems with var**
- Can be redeclared in the same scope → easy to overwrite by mistake.

**Why let and const are better**
- Block-scoped → behaves more predictably inside {}.
- Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) → throws an error if used before declaration.

### Strings
While working with strings, if one of the operand is string, it implictly converts the other to string as well. This is called **Type coercion**.
Rule:
If one operand is a string, JavaScript will implicitly convert the other operand to a string, and then concatenate.

1. The '+' Operand

Example:
```js
"hey" + 5        // "hey5"   (5 → "5")
7 + "Thala"      // "7Thala" (7 → "7")
"Age: " + true   // "Age: true" (true → "true")
"Value: " + null // "Value: null"
```

We saw what '+' does, lets see what other operands does:

2. Other Arithmetic Operators (-, *, /, %)

Unlike +, these operators never concatenate strings.
Instead, they try to convert both operands to numbers first.

``` js
"10" - 5   // 5   ("10" → 10)
"10" * 2   // 20  ("10" → 10)
"20" / 2   // 10  ("20" → 20)
"7" % 3    // 1   ("7" → 7)
```

In case if the conversion fails,

```js 
"hello" - 5   // NaN
"world" * 2   // NaN
```

3. Special Values

Boolean
``` js
true + true   // 2   (true → 1)
true * 10     // 10  (true → 1)
false + 1     // 1   (false → 0)
```

Null
```js 
null + 5   // 5   (null → 0)
null * 2   // 0
```

Undefined
```js
undefined + 5  // NaN (undefined → NaN in numeric ops)
undefined - 1  // NaN
```

Reference Table:
| Operand(s) Example | Result  | Reason                                |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `"10" + 5`         | `"105"` | String concatenation                  |
| `5 + "10"`         | `"510"` | String concatenation                  |
| `"10" - 5`         | `5`     | String coerced to number              |
| `"5" * 2`          | `10`    | String coerced to number              |
| `"hi" * 2`         | `NaN`   | Cannot convert "hi" to number         |
| `true + 1`         | `2`     | true → 1                              |
| `false + 1`        | `1`     | false → 0                             |
| `null + 1`         | `1`     | null → 0                              |
| `undefined + 1`    | `NaN`   | undefined → NaN in numeric conversion |
