## Topic: Internet Basics

### 1. What is the Internet?
- A **global network of networks** that connects billions of devices.
- Data travels in **packets** across cables, routers, satellites, etc.
- Uses rules called **protocols** (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS) so devices can communicate.

---

### 2. IP Addresses
- **IP (Internet Protocol) address** = like a postal address for devices.  
- Two kinds:
  - **Public IP** â†’ unique on the internet, assigned by your ISP (e.g., `74.125.xx.xx`).  
  - **Private IP** â†’ used inside local networks (e.g., `192.168.1.5`).  

ðŸ‘‰ Devices at home get **private IPs** from the router. The router itself has **one public IP**.

---

### 3. NAT (Network Address Translation)
- A process routers use to let multiple devices share one public IP.
- **How it works:**
  1. Device sends packet with private IP + source port.  
  2. Router replaces private IP with its public IP and assigns a new source port.  
  3. Router saves mapping in its **NAT table**.  
  4. Replies from the internet come back to the router, which looks up the table and forwards to the correct device.

ðŸ‘‰ Without NAT, billions of devices couldnâ€™t share limited IPv4 addresses.

### 4. Ports
- **Port = number (0â€“65535)** that identifies *which application/service* should handle data.  
- **Destination Port (server side):** fixed and well-known.  
  - `80` â†’ HTTP (websites)  
  - `443` â†’ HTTPS (secure websites)  
  - `25` â†’ SMTP (email)  
- **Source Port (client side):** random, temporary, chosen by your device to keep multiple connections separate.

ðŸ‘‰ Together, IP + Port = a **socket** that uniquely identifies a conversation.

### 5. Example: Laptop Accessing Facebook

#### Step 1: Inside Your Laptop
- Laptop has **private IP**: `192.168.1.5`  
- Browser picks random **source port**: `51432`  
- Packet looks like:  
  `192.168.1.5:51432 â†’ 157.240.xx.xx:443`

---

#### Step 2: Router (NAT Translation)
- Router has **public IP**: `74.125.xx.xx`  
- Rewrites packet:  
  `74.125.xx.xx:60001 â†’ 157.240.xx.xx:443`  
- Saves mapping in NAT table:  
  `74.125.xx.xx:60001 â†’ 192.168.1.5:51432`

---

#### Step 3: Across the Internet
- Packet travels across ISPs/backbones.  
- Facebook sees:  
  `74.125.xx.xx:60001 â†’ 157.240.xx.xx:443`

---

#### Step 4: Facebookâ€™s Reply
- Reply comes back as:  
  `157.240.xx.xx:443 â†’ 74.125.xx.xx:60001`

---

#### Step 5: Router Forwards
- Router checks NAT table.  
- Maps `60001` back to laptop.  
- Rewrites:  
  `157.240.xx.xx:443 â†’ 192.168.1.5:51432`

---

#### Step 6: Laptop Receives
- Laptop sees the packet arrive at source port `51432`.  
- Browser knows this is the Facebook tab â†’ page loads.

---

### 6. One Wi-Fi vs Different Wi-Fi
- **Same Wi-Fi/router:** devices share the same public IP, NAT + ports keep traffic separate.  
- **Different Wi-Fi networks:** each router has its own public IP, so devices appear different to the internet.  
- **Phone Wi-Fi vs mobile data:** switching networks changes your public IP.

---

**Rule of Thumb**  
- **IP** = which device/network.  
- **Port** = which app/service.  
- **NAT** = routerâ€™s translator, letting many devices share one public IP.
