## Topics Covered: Introduction to SQL

- SQL is the standard query language of the relational database.
- SQL Statements are the instructions that tell the database what actions to perform.
- A statement is composed of sequence of tokens, terminated by a semi-colon.

- A token can be
    - A Keyword such as **SELECT**, **UPDATE** or **VALUES**
    - An Identifer: Name of the database object such as column, table or database
    - A literal: A string or a number. Strings are enclosed by single quotes

Example:
``` sql
SELECT firstname, lastname
FROM Employees
WHERE lastname = @TargetName;
```

Keywords - SELECT, FROM, WHERE (They are reserved words that tell SQL what action to perform)
Identifers - firstname, lastname, Employees
Literal - 'Smith'

### Valid Identifiers:
- Must begin with a letter (Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z) or an underscore (_).
- Can contain letters, digits (0â€“9), and underscores.
- Maximum of 63 characters.
- Avoid reserved keywords

### Postgres Naming Conventions
Covventions doesn't mean rules, its just agreed upon practices for readability, consistency, and maintainability.
    - Postgres folds unquoted identifiers to lowercase, so using lowercase
    avoids confusion.
    - Use underscores to separate words, e.g., order_date
    - Use id as the primary key column name
    - Prefix foreign keys with the referenced table name, e.g., employee_id

### NULL VALUE

- NULL represents a missing, unknown, or undefined value.
- When arithmetic or comparison operators have one or more NULL operands, the result is NULL. 
    - 3 + NULL = NULL
    - 100 > NULL, 300 != NULL both evaluate to NULL
- Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL operator to check if a value is or is not NULL

#### Logical Operatiors with NULL

In SQL, logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) work with **three values**:  
- `TRUE`  
- `FALSE`  
- `NULL` (represents **UNKNOWN**)  

This leads to special truth table behavior.

##### 1. TRUE AND NULL
- `AND` is only true if **both sides are definitely true**.  
- One side is `TRUE`, the other is `UNKNOWN`.  
- Result â†’ `UNKNOWN (NULL)` âœ…  

ðŸ‘‰ **TRUE AND NULL = NULL**

---

##### 2. TRUE OR NULL
- `OR` is true if **at least one side is definitely true**.  
- One side is `TRUE`.  
- Result â†’ `TRUE` âœ…  

ðŸ‘‰ **TRUE OR NULL = TRUE**

---

##### 3. FALSE AND NULL
- `AND` requires both to be true.  
- One side is `FALSE`.  
- Result â†’ `FALSE` âœ…  

ðŸ‘‰ **FALSE AND NULL = FALSE**

---

##### 4. FALSE OR NULL
- `OR` is true if at least one side is true.  
- One side is `FALSE`, the other is `UNKNOWN`.  
- Result â†’ `UNKNOWN (NULL)` âœ…  

ðŸ‘‰ **FALSE OR NULL = NULL**

---

##### 5. NULL AND NULL
- Both are `UNKNOWN`.  
- Cannot confirm either as true.  
- Result â†’ `UNKNOWN (NULL)` âœ…  

ðŸ‘‰ **NULL AND NULL = NULL**

---

##### 6. NULL OR NULL
- Both are `UNKNOWN`.  
- Cannot confirm either as true.  
- Result â†’ `UNKNOWN (NULL)` âœ…  

ðŸ‘‰ **NULL OR NULL = NULL**

---

##### 7. NOT NULL
- `NOT` flips `TRUE` â†” `FALSE`.  
- But `NULL` means `UNKNOWN`. Flipping doesnâ€™t help.  
- Result â†’ `UNKNOWN (NULL)` âœ…  

ðŸ‘‰ **NOT NULL = NULL**
