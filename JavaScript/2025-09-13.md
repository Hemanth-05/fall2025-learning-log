## Topic: HTTP Status Codes in APIs, Deleting Resource

### HTTP Status Codes in APIs

When building APIs, **status codes** are very important because they tell the client what happened with their request.

---

#### ✅ Correct vs ❌ Wrong Usage

- If you send the correct code (`200`, `201`, `204`, etc.), the client immediately understands what happened.
- If you send the wrong code, the client will still **receive the response** and it will **work**, but it’s considered **bad practice**.

---

#### Why Use Correct Status Codes?

1. **Clarity** – Tells the client exactly what happened.  
   - `200 OK` → request succeeded.  
   - `201 Created` → new resource was created.  
   - `204 No Content` → deleted or updated with no response body.  

2. **Error handling** – Clients (like Axios, fetch) check status codes to decide whether to throw an error. Wrong codes = messy error handling.

3. **Standards** – Following conventions makes your API predictable and professional.

#### Example of sending the code 
``` js
app.get("/api/blogs", (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({message: "Sending all Blogs"});
})
```

#### Rule of Thumb

- **GET** → `200 OK` (if found), `404 Not Found` (if missing).  
- **POST** → `201 Created` (if created), `400 Bad Request` (if invalid data).  
- **PUT / PATCH** → `200 OK` (if updated with response), `204 No Content` (if updated without response), `404 Not Found` (if missing).  
- **DELETE** → `204 No Content` (if deleted), `404 Not Found` (if missing).  

---

#### ⚠️ Key Point

Even if you use the wrong code (e.g., send `200` instead of `201`), the client will still **work** and show the data.  
But it’s **bad practice** because it makes your API unclear and unreliable.

---

#### ✅ Best Practice

Always return the **most appropriate status code** for the situation.  
It keeps your API clean, predictable, and easy to use.

### Deleting Resources (DELETE)

When deleting, you have a few correct options depending on whether you want to return content:

#### 1. **Express chainable style**
```js
res.status(204).send();
```

#### 2. **Raw Node.js style**
```js
res.statusCode = 204;
res.end();
```

#### 3. **Shortcut method**
```js
res.sendStatus(204);
```

⚡ All three send a proper `204 No Content` response.  
- Use **`res.status(204).send()`** if you want clarity and flexibility.  
- Use **`res.sendStatus(204)`** if you just want a quick, clean status-only response.  
- Use **`res.statusCode = 204; res.end();`** if you prefer Node.js low-level style.
